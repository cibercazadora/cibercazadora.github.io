 For the past 15 years, I've lived in Hawaii with my two rambunctious boys and fun loving husband. Before Hawaii, my husband and I were prior active duty Air Force, and both grew up in military households traveling and bouncing from school to school.

I'm currently a computer systems engineer for a small rural private school, where I do a wide variety of cybersecurity, networking, programming, tech support, and systems administration tasks. I'm also an online part-time lecturer. 

My past roles include tech support, tech business owner, web application penetration tester, web design, network admin, Sunday school teacher, Cyberpatriots coach, robotics and coding MS and HS afterschool teacher. 

Whenever I can spend a free moment alone, I spend time with my family, engage in my addiction to technology, entertain my passionate in cybersecurity, exercise, and sometimes paint or draw.

My M.S. in Information Security Assurance was earned through Western Governor's University (2012) and my B.S. in Computer Information and Technology with Minor in Business is from University of Maryland University College (2007). I hold four active computer certifications: CISSP, CEH, CHFI, CompTIA Network +, and previously CCNA, GIAC ISO Specialist.

My passion started with a Commodorex64, which led to helping anyone I could in my community and family, to a full career. I am continuously working to expand my knowledge and experience in the technical and cybersecurity industry and really enjoy sharing it with anyone who wants to listen. I hope to be a source of encouragement and motivation for you in completing your life skills and goals.
